	=======================  REACT DAY - 01 =======================
Below is your content **rewritten clearly, correctly, and systematically**, in **simple English**, as **clean study notes**.

---

## What is React?

* **React is a JavaScript Library**
* Used to build **interactive User Interfaces (UI)**
* Mainly used for **Web UI**
* Focuses only on the **View layer (Frontend UI)**
* React does **NOT** control the full application flow

👉 **React = UI only**

---

## Can we build APK using React alone?

❌ **NO**

* React alone **cannot build APK**
* React **needs a framework or platform support**

### To build apps:

* **Web Apps** → React + Framework
* **Mobile Apps (APK)** → React Native (separate framework)

---

## Frameworks that support React

React needs a **framework** to manage:

* Routing
* Server-side rendering
* App flow
* Performance optimization

### Examples:

* **Next.js** → React framework (Server-side rendering)
* **Remix** → React framework
* **Backend support**:

  * Node.js
  * Express.js
  * Java APIs

---

## React Summary

* React is **only for UI**
* Cannot control full application
* Needs frameworks to build **complete apps**

---

## Angular vs React

### React

* JavaScript **Library**
* Lightweight
* Faster UI rendering
* Used mainly for **Frontend**
* Needs external libraries/frameworks

### Angular

* Complete **Framework**
* Heavy
* Slower compared to React
* Controls full application flow
* Built-in tools (routing, forms, HTTP)

---

## Important Truth (For Jobs)

❌ **Angular OR React** – ❌ Wrong
✅ **Angular AND React** – ✅ Correct

👉 **Experienced developers are expected to know BOTH**

---

## Library vs Framework

### Library (React)

* Smaller
* You control the flow
* Cannot manage full app alone

### Framework (Angular / Next.js)

* Bigger
* Framework controls app flow
* Can build full applications
* Can manage APK / Web / Backend flow

---

## Where React is Used?

* Frontend UI
* Fast and smooth interfaces
* Modern websites
* Better performance than Angular for UI

---

## Where Angular is Used?

* Enterprise applications
* Large-scale projects
* Structured and controlled apps
* Slightly heavier than React

---

## Why Companies Expect Both?

* Different project needs
* Some projects use React
* Some projects use Angular
* Flexibility in team requirements

---

## Why React & Angular Were Introduced (Around 2014)?

To solve **Modern Web Development Challenges**

---

## Challenges in Modern Web

### 1. Unified UX (User Experience)

* Same experience on:

  * Mobile
  * Laptop
  * Tablet
* Example: **YouTube**

  * Same UI on PC & Mobile browser

---

### 2. Fluid UX

* Smooth user experience
* No full page reload
* Uses **AJAX**
* User scrolls instead of loading pages

👉 This is called **Single Page Application (SPA)**

---

### 3. Loosely Coupled & Extensible

* Add new features easily
* No disturbance to existing code
* Easy maintenance

---

## Important Facts

* Mobile browsers are:

  * Compact
  * Optimized
  * Compressed

---

## World’s First Single Page App

* **Twitter**
* Existed before React & Angular

---

## Key Terms

### Legacy Devices

* Old devices
* Low performance
* Limited memory

### Eager Loading

* Loads everything at once
* Slower initial load

---

## Final Solution

### Build Better Applications Using:

### 1. SPA (Single Page Application)

* One page
* Fast
* Smooth scrolling

### 2. PWA (Progressive Web Application)

* App-like experience
* Works offline
* Example:

  * **VS Code Online**
* Better than SPA

---

## Final Conclusion

* React → UI Library
* Angular → Full Framework
* Frameworks are larger than libraries
* React alone cannot build APK
* Companies expect knowledge of both
* SPA & PWA solve modern web problems
